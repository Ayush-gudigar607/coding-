DATA COMMUNICATIONS  \\nData communication is the process of transferring data from one point to another using a \\ncommunication system. It involves several essential components and mechanisms to ensure the \\naccurate and timely delivery of data. \\n1.1. Components  \\nA data communication system includes the following components: \\n \\nFigure 1.1: A data communications system has five components \\n1. Message: The data or information being communicated (e.g., text, images, audio). \\n2. Sender: The device that sends the message, such as a computer or smartphone. \\n3. Receiver: The device that receives the message, like another computer or a printer. \\n4. Transmission Medium: The physical path through which the data is transmitted, like \\ncables or radio waves. \\n5. Protocol: A set of rules that governs the communication between devices to ensure proper \\ndata exchange. \\nThe performance of a data communication system relies on four key characteristics: delivery, \\naccuracy, timeliness, and jitter. \\n1. Delivery: The system must ensure that data reaches the correct destination. Only the \\nintended recipient—whether a device or a user—should receive the data. \\n2. Accuracy: Data must be transmitted without errors. If data is altered during transmission \\nand not corrected, it becomes unusable. \\n3. Timeliness: Data must be delivered promptly. Delayed data, especially in applications like \\nvideo and audio, lose their value. For real-time transmission, data must be delivered in the \\nsame sequence and without significant delays.'),\n",

Jitter: Jitter refers to the inconsistency in packet arrival times. Inconsistent delays, such as \\nvideo packets arriving at varying intervals, can degrade the quality of the audio or video. \\nFor instance, if video packets are sent every 30 ms, but some arrive after 40 ms, the video \\nquality will be affected. \\n \\n1.2. Data Representation  \\nData can be represented in various forms to suit the type of communication. Common types of \\ndata representation include: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nText: Represented as a sequence of bits using encoding systems like ASCII or Unicode. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nNumbers: Represented directly in binary form, which allows for efficient computation and \\ntransmission. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nImages: Represented as a matrix of pixels, where each pixel is assigned a bit pattern based \\non the image's color or intensity. Color images often use RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or YCM \\n(Yellow, Cyan, Magenta) encoding. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAudio: Audio data is captured as a continuous signal, which can be sampled and digitized \\nfor transmission. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nVideo: A sequence of images or frames is used to convey motion, with each frame \\nrepresented as individual bit patterns. \\n \\n1.3. Data Flow  \\nData flow refers to the manner in which data is transmitted between two devices. It can happen \\nin three modes: \\n1. Simplex: Data flows in one direction only, like a keyboard sending data to a computer \\n(one-way communication). \\n2. Half-Duplex: Both devices can send and receive data, but not at the same time. For \\nexample, a walkie-talkie allows communication in both directions, but one at a time. \\n3. Full-Duplex: Both devices can transmit and receive data simultaneously, like in a phone \\nconversation where both parties can speak and listen at the same time.\"),\n",

Networks are connected through \\ntransmission media, either wired (like cables) or wireless (like air). \\n2.1. Network Criteria  \\nNetworks must meet several essential criteria to be effective, namely: \\n1. Performance: This is evaluated by: \\no Transit time: Time for a message to travel between two devices. \\no Response time: Time between sending a request and receiving a response. Factors \\ninfluencing performance include the number of users, the transmission medium, \\nhardware capabilities, and software efficiency. Key metrics include: \\no Throughput: Amount of data transmitted successfully. \\no Delay: Time taken for data to reach its destination. Optimizing both often leads to \\ntrade-offs. \\n2. Reliability: This includes: \\no Accuracy in data delivery. \\no Frequency and recovery time from network failures. \\no The network’s ability to function during a catastrophe. \\n3. Security: It encompasses protecting data from unauthorized access, damage, or corruption \\nand establishing recovery procedures for security breaches.'),\n",

Instead, it \\naccommodates a wide range of both standard and proprietary protocols. Any protocol that can \\nencapsulate a datagram and move it across a link is considered acceptable. \\nAt the data-link layer, the datagram is encapsulated into a packet, referred to as a frame. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nSome link-layer protocols offer both error detection and correction, ensuring that \\ntransmitted data is free from errors. \\nNetwork Layer: \\nThe network layer is crucial for establishing communication between the source and destination \\ncomputers.

The main role of the \\nnetwork layer is to enable communication between hosts and determine the best path for data \\ntransmission. \\nInternet Protocol (IP) \\nThe primary protocol of the network layer is the Internet Protocol (IP), which defines the \\nstructure and format of data packets, known as datagrams at this level.

Port numbers identify the specific \\napplication-layer programs (e.g., web server-Port 80, email client - Port 25) on the \\nsource and destination devices. Each running program has its own port number, \\nensuring that data reaches the correct application. \\no Packet name: Segment (for TCP) or User Datagram (for UDP).\"),\n",

Each wire in the \\npair serves a different function: one carries the signal to the receiver, and the other acts as a ground \\nreference. The receiver processes the difference between the two wires to retrieve the signal. \\n \\nFigure 1.28: Twisted-pair cable \\nNoise and Interference \\nTwisted pair cables are designed to minimize the impact of interference (noise) and crosstalk. \\nWhen the wires are parallel, noise or crosstalk can affect each wire differently due to their varying \\ndistances from the sources of interference. By twisting the wires, the cable maintains a balance. In \\neach twist, the relative positions of the wires to the noise source change, helping to ensure that \\nboth wires experience similar levels of interference. This twisting reduces the impact of unwanted \\nsignals, as the receiver calculates the difference between the wires, canceling out most of the noise. \\nShielded vs. Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cables \\n\\uf0b7 \\nUnshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP): The most common type used in communications, UTP \\ncables do not have additional shielding. They are less expensive and less bulky but can be \\nmore susceptible to interference. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nShielded Twisted-Pair (STP): STP cables have an additional metal foil or braided mesh \\ncovering each pair of conductors. This shielding reduces interference and improves signal'),\n",

The sending and receiving \\nantennas don’t need to be aligned for successful communication, as any receiving antenna \\nin range can pick up the signal.

This is useful because devices like AM radios can receive \\nsignals indoors. However, it can also be a disadvantage, as signals cannot be restricted to \\nonly the inside or outside of a building, leading to potential signal leakage. \\nLimitations: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe radio wave band is relatively narrow, just under 1 GHz.

For instance, if a switch is busy processing other packets, newly arrived \\npackets must wait their turn, which can increase transmission time. \\nTypes of Packet-Switched Networks: \\n1. Datagram Networks: In these networks, each packet is treated independently, and it may \\ntake different routes to reach the destination. \\n2. Virtual Circuit Networks: These networks establish a pre-determined path before any \\ndata packets are sent, ensuring all packets follow the same route. \\nPacket switching is an efficient way to transfer data, especially in systems where multiple users \\nneed to share the same network resources. \\n8.1. Datagram Networks  \\nIn a datagram network, each packet is handled independently, even if it's part of a larger \\ntransmission. The network treats each packet as if it stands alone. These individual packets are \\nknown as datagrams. \\nKey Features of Datagram Networks: \\n1. Packet Independence: Each packet in a datagram network can take a different path to its \\ndestination, and the network doesn't maintain any connection state between sender and \\nreceiver. \\n2. Routing: Packet routing is typically done at the network layer, where packets are \\nforwarded based on their destination address. The devices that manage packet routing are \\ncalled routers.\"),\n",

Connectionless: A datagram network is often referred to as a connectionless network \\nbecause it doesn’t require a setup phase (like circuit-switched networks). No information \\nabout the connection is saved, and each packet is routed independently. \\nHow Datagram Networks Work \\nIn Figure 1.43, four packets are sent from station A to station X using the datagram approach. Here, \\nswitches are called routers, and they are depicted with a different symbol. Although these four \\npackets belong to the same message, they might take different paths to reach their destination due \\nto varying link capacities and network congestion. This can lead to packets arriving out of order, \\nwith differing delays, or even being lost or dropped due to insufficient resources. Upper-layer \\nprotocols typically handle the reordering and retransmission of lost packets before delivering them \\nto the application. \\n \\nFigure 1.43: A datagram network with four switches (routers) \\nRouting Table \\nIn a datagram network, each switch uses a routing table based on destination addresses to forward \\npackets. These tables are dynamic and updated regularly.  \\n \\nFigure 1.44: Routing table in a datagram network'),\n",

Otherwise, there is an error somewhere and the data are not accepted. \\n➔ We can make the job of the receiver easier if we send the negative (complement) of the \\nsum, called the checksum. \\n➔  In this case, we send (7, 11, 12,0,6, -36). The receiver can add all the numbers received \\n(including the checksum).

Two events may occur: \\na. If an error-free frame arrives, the message in the frame is delivered to the network layer \\nand an ACK is sent. \\nb. If a corrupted frame arrives, the frame is discarded. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure shows an example. The first frame is sent and acknowledged. The second frame is sent, \\nbut lost. After time-out, it is resent. The third frame is sent and acknowledged, but the \\nacknowledgment is lost. The frame is resent. However, there is a problem with this scheme. The \\nNetwork layer at the receiver site receives two copies of the third packet, which is not right.  \\nSequence and Acknowledgment Numbers \\n➔ Duplicate packets, as much as corrupted packets, need to be avoided. As an example, \\nassume we are ordering some item online. \\n➔  If each packet defines the specification of an item to be ordered, duplicate packets mean \\nordering an item more than once.  \\n➔ o correct the problem in Example, we need to add sequence numbers to the data frames \\nand acknowledgment numbers to the ACK frames.  \\n➔ Numbering in this case is very simple. Sequence numbers are 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . . ; the \\nacknowledgment numbers can also be 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, …  \\n➔ An acknowledgment number always defines the sequence number of the next frame to \\nreceive.'),\n",

With 2 bits, \\nwe can have four types of S-frames, as described below: \\n1. Receive ready (RR). If the value of the code subfield is 00, it is an RR S-frame. Receive \\nnot ready (RNR). If the value of the code subfield is 10, it is an RNR S-frame. The value \\nof NCR is the acknowledgment number. \\n2. Reject (REJ). If the value of the code subfield is 01, it is a REJ S-frame. The value of \\nNCR) is the negative acknowledgment number. \\n3. Selective reject (SREJ).

The idea is that each station sends \\na frame whenever it has a frame to send.  \\n➔ Since there is only one channel to share, there is the possibility of collision between \\nframes from different stations. \\n➔ There are four stations (unrealistic assumption) that contend with one another for access \\nto the shared channel. Only two frames survive: frame 1.1 from station 1 and frame 3.2 \\nfrom station 3. \\n \\n➔ The pure ALOHA protocol relies on acknowledgments from the receiver. If the \\nacknowledgment does not arrive after a time-out period, the station resends the frame. \\n➔ If all these stations try to resend their frames after the time-out, the frames will collide \\nagain. Each station waits for a random time before resending, called the back-off time TB. \\n➔ In the  second method  after a maximum number of retransmission attempts Kmax' a \\nstation must give up and try later.\"),\n",

In data communication, there are two main \\nswitching types: circuit switching and packet switching. Circuit switching is mostly used at the \\nphysical layer, but at the network layer, only packet switching is used because data is sent as \\npackets. \\nWhen a message is sent from one device to another, it is divided into packets. The source sends \\nthese packets one by one, and the destination waits for all packets to arrive before reconstructing \\nthe message. To send the packets, the network uses two routing methods: the datagram \\napproach and the virtual circuit approach. \\n. \\nDatagram Approach: Connectionless Service \\n➔ When the network layer provides a connectionless service, each packet traveling in the \\nInternet is an independent entity; there is no relationship between packets belonging to \\nthe same message.  \\n➔ The switches in this type of network are called routers.  \\n➔ A packet belonging to a message may be followed by a packet belonging to the same \\nmessage or to a different message.  \\n➔   A packet may be followed by a packet coming from the same or from a different source. \\n➔ Each packet is routed based on the information contained in its header: source and \\ndestination addresses. The destination address defines where it should go; the source \\naddress defines where it comes from. T \\n➔ he router in this case routes the packet based only on the destination address. The source \\naddress may be used to send an error message to the source if the packet is discarded. \\n➔ Figure shows the forwarding process in a router in this case. We have used symbolic \\naddresses such as A and B.'),\n",

All routers delete the \\ncorresponding entries from their tables. \\n  \\nIPV4 ADDRESSES \\n \\nThe identifier used in the IP layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite to identify the connection of each \\ndevice to the Internet is called the Internet address or IP address. An IPv4 address is a 32-bit \\naddress that uniquely and universally defines the connection of a host or a router to the Internet. \\nThe IP address is the address of the connection, not the host or the router, because if the device is \\nmoved to another network, the IP address may be changed.  \\nIPv4 addresses are unique in the sense that each address defines one, and only one, connection to \\nthe Internet. If a device has two connections to the Internet, via two networks, it has two IPv4 \\naddresses. IPv4 addresses are universal in the sense that the addressing system must be accepted \\nby any host that wants to be connected to the Internet. \\n \\nAddress Space \\nA protocol like IPv4 that defines addresses has an address space. An address space is the total \\nnumber of addresses used by the protocol. If a protocol uses b bits to define an address, the \\naddress space is 2b  because each bit can have two different values (0 or 1). \\nIPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which means that the address space is 232 or 4,294,967,296 (more \\nthan four billion). If there were no restrictions, more than 4 billion devices could be connected to \\nthe Internet.  \\n \\nNotation \\nThere are three common notations to show an IPv4 address: binary notation (base 2), dotted-\\ndecimal notation (base 256), and hexadecimal notation (base 16). In binary notation, an IPv4 \\naddress is displayed as 32 bits.  \\nTo make the address more readable, one or more spaces are usually inserted between each octet \\n(8 bits). Each octet is often referred to as a byte. To make the IPv4 address more compact and \\neasier to read, it is usually written in decimal form with a decimal point (dot) separating the \\nbytes. This format is referred to as dotted-decimal notation. Note that because each byte (octet) is \\nonly 8 bits, each number in the dotted-decimal notation is between 0 and 255. We sometimes see'),\n",

In a postal network, the postal address (mailing \\naddress) includes the country, state, city, street, house number, and the name of the mail \\nrecipient. Similarly, a telephone number is divided into the country code, area code, local \\nexchange, and the connection.  \\nA 32-bit IPv4 address is also hierarchical, but divided only into two parts.

The whole address space was divided into five \\nclasses (class A, B, C, D, and E). This scheme is referred to as classful addressing. \\n➔ In class A, the network length is 8 bits, but since the first bit, which is 0, defines the class, \\nwe can have only seven bits as the network identifier. This means there are only 27 = 128 \\nnetworks in the world that can have a class A address.  \\n➔ In class B, the network length is 16 bits, but since the first two bits, which are (10)2, \\ndefine the class, we can have only 14 bits as the network identifier. This means there are \\nonly 214 = 16,384 networks in the world that can have a class B address. \\n➔ All addresses that start with (110)2 belong to class C. In class C, the network length is 24 \\nbits, but since three bits define the class, we can have only 21 bits as the network \\nidentifier. This means there are 221 = 2,097,152 networks in the world that can have a \\nclass C address. \\n \\n \\nClass D is not divided into prefix and suffix. It is used for multicast addresses. All addresses that \\nstart with 1111 in binary belong to class E. As in Class D, Class E is not divided into prefix and \\nsuffix and is used as reserve. \\n \\nAddress Depletion  \\nClassful addressing became obsolete due to address depletion. The inefficient distribution of \\naddresses led to a rapid shortage. For example, Class A, which could only be assigned to 128 \\norganizations, provided more addresses (16.7 million per network) than most needed, resulting in \\nwasted space.

Subnetting \\ndivides large blocks (Class A or B) into smaller subnets with longer prefixes, but it failed \\nbecause large organizations didn\\'t want to share unused addresses. Supernetting combined \\nmultiple Class C blocks to create larger blocks for organizations needing more than 256 \\naddresses, but this made packet routing more complex and also proved ineffective. \\n \\nAdvantage of Classful Addressing \\nAlthough classful addressing had several problems and became obsolete, it had one advantage: \\nGiven an address, we can easily find the class of the address and, since the prefix length for each \\nclass is fixed, we can find the prefix length immediately.  \\n \\nClassless Addressing  \\nSubnetting and supernetting didn\\'t fully solve address depletion. As the Internet grew, it became \\nclear that a larger address space was needed, leading to the development of IPv6 as a long-term \\nsolution. However, a short-term fix was classless addressing, which kept IPv4 but removed \\nclass boundaries to distribute addresses more fairly. \\nISPs played a role in this change, providing Internet access by subdividing large address ranges \\nand assigning smaller blocks (1, 2, 4, etc.) to customers. Classless addressing, introduced in \\n1996, allows for variable-length blocks of addresses (e.g., 1, 2, 4, or 128). The prefix of the \\naddress identifies the network, while the suffix identifies the device. The number of addresses in \\neach block must be a power of 2, and the blocks are non-overlapping. \\n \\n \\nIn classless addressing, the prefix length is variable, ranging from 0 to 32. A shorter prefix \\nindicates a larger network, while a longer prefix means a smaller network. Classless addressing \\ncan be applied to classful addressing by treating Class A as having a prefix of 8, Class B with a \\nprefix of 16, and so on. \\n \\nPrefix Length and Slash Notation (CIDR) \\nIn classless addressing, the prefix length (n) is added to the address, separated by a slash, known \\nas slash notation or CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). For example, in 167.199.170.82/27, \\n\"27\" is the prefix length. This notation is necessary since the address alone does not define the \\nblock. \\nTo extract information from a classless address: \\n \\nNumber of addresses = 2^(32 - n) \\nFirst address: Keep the first n bits, set the rest to 0. \\nLast address: Keep the first n bits, set the rest to 1. \\nFor 167.199.170.82/27, there are 32 addresses in the block.'),\n",

Since the value of prefix length, n, is given, we can  \\neasily find these three pieces of information, as shown in Figure 18.21.  \\n1. The number of addresses in the block is found as N = 232−n .  \\n2. To find the first address, we keep the n leftmost bits and set the (32 − n) rightmost  bits \\nall to 0s. \\n3. To find the last address, we keep the n leftmost bits and set the (32 − n) rightmost  bits all \\nto 1s. \\nExample 1 \\nA classless address is given as 167.199.170.82/27. We can find the above three pieces of \\ninformation as follows. The number of addresses in the network is 232 − n  = 25 = 32 addresses. \\n \\n \\n \\nAddress Mask  \\nAnother way to find the first and last addresses in the block is to use the address mask.  The \\naddress mask is a 32-bit number in which the n leftmost bits are set to 1s and the  rest of the bits \\n(32 − n) are set to 0s. A computer can easily find the address mask  because it is the complement \\nof (232 − n − 1). The reason for defining a mask in this way  is that it can be used by a computer \\nprogram to extract the information in a block, using  the three bit-wise operations NOT, AND, \\nand OR.  \\n1. The number of addresses in the block N = NOT (mask) + 1.'),\n",

The network address is \\nactually the identifier of the network; each network is identified by its network address. \\n \\nBlock Allocation \\nBlock allocation is managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \\n(ICANN), which assigns large blocks of addresses to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) rather \\nthan individual users. For CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) to function correctly, two key \\nrestrictions are applied to the allocated block: \\n1. The number of requested addresses, N, needs to be a power of 2. The reason is that N = \\n232 − n or n = 32 − log2N. If N is not a power of 2, we cannot have an integer value for \\nn. \\n2. The requested block must be allocated where enough contiguous addresses are available. \\nThe first address in the block must be divisible by the total number of addresses. This \\nensures the first address is the prefix followed by (32 − n) zeros, making it divisible by \\nthe block size. \\nfirst address = (prefix in decimal) × 232 − n = (prefix in decimal) × N. \\n \\nExample  \\nAn ISP has requested a block of 1000 addresses. Since 1000 is not a power of 2, 1024 addresses  \\nare granted. The prefix length is calculated as n = 32 − log21024 = 22. An available block,  \\n18.14.12.0/22, is granted to the ISP. It can be seen that the first address in decimal is  \\n302,910,464, which is divisible by 1024. \\n \\nSubnetting  \\nMore levels of hierarchy can be created using subnetting. An organization (or an ISP) that is \\ngranted a range of addresses may divide the range into several subranges and  assign each \\nsubrange to a subnetwork (or subnet). Note that nothing stops the organization from creating \\nmore levels. A subnetwork can be divided into several sub-subnetworks.  A sub-subnetwork can \\nbe divided into several sub-sub-subnetworks, and so on. \\n \\nDesigning Subnets  \\nThe subnetworks in a network should be carefully designed to enable the routing of pack \\nets. We assume the total number of addresses granted to the organization is N, the prefix  \\nlength is n, the assigned number of addresses to each subnetwork is Nsub, and the prefix  \\nlength for each subnetwork is nsub. Then the following steps need to be carefully followed  \\nto guarantee the proper operation of the subnetworks.  \\n1. The number of addresses in each subnetwork should be a power of 2.  \\n2. The prefix length for each subnetwork should be found using the following formula:  first \\naddress = (prefix in decimal) × 232 − n = (prefix in decimal) × N.  \\nnsub = 32 − log2Nsub'),\n",

When blocks of addresses are combined to create a \\nlarger block, routing can be done based on the prefix of the larger block. ICANN assigns a large \\nblock of addresses to an ISP. Each ISP in turn divides its assigned block into smaller subblocks \\nand grants the subblocks to its customers. \\nExample  \\nFigure 18.24 shows how four small blocks of addresses are assigned to four organizations by an  \\nISP. The ISP combines these four blocks into one single block and advertises the larger block to  \\nthe rest of the world. Any packet destined for this larger block should be sent to this ISP. It is the  \\nresponsibility of the ISP to forward the packet to the appropriate organization. This is similar to \\nrouting we can find in a postal network. All packages coming from outside a country are sent \\nfirst to the capital and then distributed to the corresponding destination. \\n \\n \\nSpecial Addresses \\n1. This-host Address (0.0.0.0/32): Used when a host doesn’t know its own address. \\n2. Limited-broadcast Address (255.255.255.255/32): Used to send a datagram to all \\ndevices within a network. Routers block this outside the network. \\n3. Loopback Address (127.0.0.0/8): Used for testing software on the same host; packets \\nnever leave the host. \\n4. Private Addresses: Reserved for internal use (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, \\n192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16); used with NAT. \\n5. Multicast Addresses (224.0.0.0/4): Reserved for multicast communication. \\n \\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) \\nDHCP is an application-layer protocol that automates IP address assignment, using a client-\\nserver model. Widely used on the Internet, it is often referred to as a \"plug-and-play\" protocol. \\n• \\nAddress Assignment: DHCP can assign permanent or temporary IP addresses. For \\nexample, ISPs can use DHCP to provide temporary addresses to users, allowing limited \\nIP resources to serve more customers.'),\n",

This is called fragmentation. \\n➔ When a datagram is fragmented, each fragment has its own header with most of the fields \\nrepeated, but some have been changed.  \\n➔ A fragmented datagram may itself be fragmented if it encounters a network with an even \\nsmaller MTU.  \\n➔ The reassembly of the datagram, is done only by the destination host, because each \\nfragment becomes an independent datagram.  \\n➔ In fragmentation, the payload of the IP datagram is fragmented. most parts of the header, \\nwith the exception of some options, must be copied by all fragments.  \\n➔ The host or router that fragments a datagram must change the values of three fields: flags, \\nfragmentation offset, and total length.  \\n➔ The value of the checksum must be recalculated regardless of fragmentation. \\n \\n \\nFields Related to Fragmentation  \\nThree fields in an IP datagram are related to fragmentation: \\n1. Identification-The 16-bit identification field identifies a datagram originating from the \\nsource host. The combination of the identification and source IP address must uniquely \\ndefine a datagram as it leaves the source host. To guarantee uniqueness, the IP protocol \\nuses a counter to label the datagrams.  The identification number helps the destination in \\nreassembling the datagram. \\n2. Flags- The 3-bit flags field defines three flags.  \\n➔ The leftmost bit is reserved (not used).  \\n➔ The second bit (D bit) is called the do not fragment bit. If its value is 1, the \\nmachine must not fragment the datagram. If its value is 0, the datagram can be \\nfragmented if necessary.  \\n➔ The third bit (M bit) is called the more fragment bit. If its value is 1, it means the \\ndatagram is not the last fragment; there are more fragments after this one. If its \\nvalue is 0, it means this is the last or only fragment. \\n3. fragmentation offset The 13-bit fragmentation offset field shows the relative position of \\nthis fragment with respect to the whole datagram. It is the offset of the data in the original \\ndatagram measured in units of 8 bytes.'),\n",

Single-Byte Options There are two single-byte options. \\nI. \\nNo Operation A no-operation option is a 1-byte option used as a filler between \\noptions. \\nII. \\nEnd of Option An end-of-option option is a 1-byte option used for padding at the \\nend of the option field.

Packet sniffing is a passive \\nattack, in which the attacker does not change the contents of the packet.  \\n➔ This type of attack is very difficult to detect because the sender and the receiver may \\nnever know that the packet has been copied. \\n➔  Although packet sniffing cannot be stopped, encryption of the packet can make the \\nattacker’s effort useless.  \\n➔ The attacker may still sniff the packet, but the content is not detectable. \\n2. Packet Modification \\n➔ The attacker intercepts the packet, changes its contents, and sends the new packet to the \\nreceiver.  \\n➔ The receiver believes that the packet is coming from the original sender. This type of \\nattack can be detected using a data integrity mechanism.  \\n➔ The receiver, before opening and using the contents of the message, can use this \\nmechanism to make sure that the packet has not been changed during the transmission. \\n3. IP Spoofing \\n➔ An attacker can masquerade as somebody else and create an IP packet that carries the \\nsource address of another computer.  \\n➔ An attacker can send an IP packet to a bank pretending that it is coming from one of the \\ncustomers. T \\n➔ This type of attack can be prevented using an origin authentication mechanism. \\nIPSec \\nThe IP packets today can be protected from the previously mentioned attacks using a protocol \\ncalled IPSec (IP Security).  IPSec provides the following four services: \\n1. Defining Algorithms and Keys. The two entities that want to create a secure channel \\nbetween them can agree on some available algorithms and keys to be used for security \\npurposes. \\n2.  Packet Encryption. The packets exchanged between two parties can be encrypted for \\nprivacy using one of the encryption algorithms and a shared key agreed upon in the first \\nstep.  \\n3. Data Integrity. Data integrity guarantees that the packet is not modified during the \\ntransmission. If the received packet does not pass the data integrity test, it is discarded.  \\n4. Origin Authentication.

The colon hexadecimal \\nnotation (or colon hex for short) divides the address into eight sections, each made of four \\nhexadecimal digits separated by colons. \\nAbbreviation \\nAlthough an IPv6 address, even in hexadecimal format, is very long, many of the digits are \\nzeros. In this case, we can abbreviate the address. The leading zeros of a section can \\nbe omitted.  Further abbreviation, often called zero compression, can be applied to colon hex \\nnotation if there are consecutive sections consisting of zeros only. We can remove all the zeros \\nand replace them with a double semicolon. \\n \\nNote that this type of abbreviation is allowed only once per address. If there is more than one run \\nof zero sections, only one of them can be compressed. \\nMixed Notation \\nSometimes we see a mixed representation of an IPv6 address: colon hex and dotted decimal \\nnotation. This is appropriate during the transition period in which an IPv4 address is embedded \\nin an IPv6 address (as the rightmost 32 bits).  \\nCIDR Notation \\nIPv6 uses hierarchical addressing. For this reason, IPv6 allows slash or CIDR notation. For \\nexample, the following shows how we can define a prefix of 60 bits using CIDR. We will later \\nshow how an IPv6 address is divided into a prefix and a suffix. \\n \\nAddress Space \\nThe address space of IPv6 contains 2128 addresses. This address space is 296 times the IPv4 \\naddress—definitely no address depletion—as shown, the size of the space is \\n \\n. \\nThree Address Types \\nIn IPv6, a destination address can belong to one of three categories: unicast, anycast, and \\nmulticast. \\n \\nUnicast Address \\nA unicast address defines a single interface (computer or router). The packet sent to a unicast \\naddress will be routed to the intended recipient. \\nAnycast Address \\nAn anycast address defines a group of computers that all share a single address. A packet with \\nan anycast address is delivered to only one member of the group, the most reachable one. \\nMulticast Address \\nA multicast address also defines a group of computers. Each member of the group receives a \\ncopy. IPv6 considers broadcasting as a special case of multicasting.'),\n",

IPv6 is designed to allow the extension of the protocol if required by \\nnew technologies or applications. \\nSupport for resource allocation. In IPv6, the type-of-service field has been removed, but two \\nnew fields, traffic class and flow label, have been added to enable the source to request special \\nhandling of the packet. This mechanism can be used to support traffic such as real-time audio \\nand video. \\n Support for more security. The encryption and authentication options in IPv6 provide \\nconfidentiality and integrity of the packet. \\nPacket Format \\nThe IPv6 packet is shown in Figure. Each packet is composed of a base header followed by the \\npayload. The base header occupies 40 bytes, whereas payload can be up to 65,535 bytes of \\ninformation. The description of fields follows. \\n \\n \\nVersion. The 4-bit version field defines the version number of the IP. For IPv6, the value is 6. \\nTraffic class. The 8-bit traffic class field is used to distinguish different payloads with different \\ndelivery requirements. It replaces the type-of-service field in IPv4. \\nFlow label. The flow label is a 20-bit field that is designed to provide special handling for a \\nparticular flow of data.  \\n Payload length. The 2-byte payload length field defines the length of the IP datagram excluding \\nthe header.'),\n",

There are several routes that a packet can travel from the \\nsource to the destination; it must be determined is which route the packet should take.'),\n",

A graph in computer \\nscience is a set of nodes and edges (lines) that connect the nodes.  \\n➔ To model an internet as a graph, we can think of each router as a node and each network \\nbetween a pair of routers as an edge.  \\n➔ An internet is, in fact, modelled as a weighted graph, in which each edge is associated \\nwith a cost.  \\n➔ If a weighted graph is used to represent a geographical area, the nodes can be cities and \\nthe edges can be roads connecting the cities; the weights, in this case, are distances \\nbetween cities.  \\n➔ In routing, however, the cost of an edge has a different interpretation in different routing \\nprotocols.  \\n \\nLeast-Cost Routing  \\n➔ When an internet is modelled as a weighted graph, one of the ways to interpret the best \\nroute from the source router to the destination router is to find the least cost between the \\ntwo.  \\n➔ In Figure below, the best route between A and E is A-B-E, with the cost of 6. This means \\nthat each router needs to find the least-cost route between itself and all the other routers \\nto be able to route a packet using this criterion. \\n \\n \\nLeast-Cost Trees \\n➔ If there are N routers in a network, each router needs to find the cheapest (least-cost) path \\nto every other router. For example, with 10 routers, you would need to calculate 90 \\ndifferent paths to connect all routers. \\n➔ Instead of calculating all the paths separately, we can group them into something called a \\nleast-cost tree (also known as a shortest-path tree). \\n➔  A least-cost tree starts from one router (the source) and connects to all the other routers \\nusing the cheapest path for each connection. This way, you can use just one tree to find \\nthe best routes from that source router to every other router.'),\n",

For a routing protocol to \\nwork properly, if a link is broken (cost becomes infinity), every other router should be aware of \\nit immediately, but in distance-vector routing, this takes some time. The problem is referred to as \\ncount to infinity. It sometimes takes several updates before the cost for a broken link is recorded \\nas infinity by all routers. \\n \\nLink-State Routing \\n➔ Link-State (LS) routing is a method used by routers to determine the best, or least-cost, \\npath through a network. \\n➔  In this method, each connection between routers is referred to as a link, and the link-\\nstate describes the cost of using that connection. Lower costs are preferred, while a link \\nwith an infinite cost means it is unavailable or broken.  \\n➔ To create efficient routing paths, each router must have a complete map of the network, \\nwhich includes the state (cost) of every link. This information is stored in the Link-State \\nDatabase (LSDB), which is shared across all routers.  \\n➔ The LSDB is often represented as a matrix, where each value shows the cost of a link \\nbetween two routers.  \\n➔ With this database, each router can build the least-cost tree, ensuring it knows the shortest \\nroutes to every other router. \\n \\n \\n➔ To create the Link-State Database (LSDB), routers use a process called flooding. Each \\nrouter sends a greeting to its direct neighbors to gather two pieces of information: the \\nneighbor's identity and the cost of the link.  \\n➔ This data is packaged into a Link-State Packet (LSP) and sent to all neighboring \\nrouters. When a router receives an LSP, it checks if the information is new by comparing \\nthe sequence number.  \\n➔ If the LSP is new, the router keeps it and sends copies to other neighbors, except the one \\nfrom which it was received.  \\n➔ This process repeats until all routers have the latest LSPs, allowing each router to create \\nan identical LSDB, which provides a complete map of the network. This LSDB helps \\nrouters calculate the least-cost paths to all other nodes.\"),\n",

For example, a sender may want to avoid \\ncertain routers due to security concerns or competition, but least-cost routing doesn't allow for \\nsuch policies. These methods only focus on minimizing cost, meaning packets could still pass \\nthrough undesired routers if they are part of the least-cost path. In some cases, such as for \\nsecurity or policy reasons, the sender may prioritize reachability over cost, ensuring that packets \\nreach their destination efficiently without considering the route's cost. \\nPath-vector (PV) routing is a routing algorithm designed to address the limitations of link-state \\n(LS) and distance-vector (DV) routing, which focus on least-cost paths. Unlike those methods, \\nPV routing allows the source to control the route based on policies, such as avoiding certain \\nrouters for security or business reasons. While primarily used for routing between ISPs, PV \\nrouting offers flexibility by letting the source determine the best route according to its own \\npolicies rather than cost. \\nSpanning Trees \\nIn path-vector routing, the route from a source to all destinations is determined by the best \\nspanning tree, but unlike the least-cost tree, the best spanning tree is chosen based on the \\nsource's policies. If multiple routes exist, the source can pick the route that aligns with its \\npreferences, which may include avoiding certain nodes or minimizing the number of nodes \\nvisited. For example, in a network of five nodes, sources like A and E may create spanning trees \\nthat avoid node D as an intermediary, while B may avoid node C.

It is an open protocol, meaning the specification is publicly available. \\nUnlike RIP, OSPF allows each link to be assigned a weight based on factors such as throughput, \\nround-trip time, or reliability, though administrators can use hop count as a cost. Different Types \\nof Service (TOS) can have different weights for cost calculation. \\n \\nMetric: \\nOSPF calculates the cost of reaching a destination from a source by considering link weights, \\nwhich can vary based on the type of service.

It provides each AS a means to  \\n1. Obtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASs.  \\n2. Propagate the reachability information to all routers internal to the AS.  \\n3. Determine “good” routes to subnets based on the reachability information and  \\non AS policy.  \\n➢ In BGP, pairs of routers exchange routing information over semi-permanent TCP  \\nconnections.  \\n➢ In Figure 31, there is a TCP connection between gateway routers 3a and 1c and another TCP \\nconnection between gateway routers 1b and 2a. \\n➢ There are also semi-permanent BGP TCP connections between routers within an AS.  \\n➢ For each TCP connection, the two routers at the end of the connection are called BGP peers,  \\nand the TCP connection along with all the BGP messages sent over the connection is called a  \\nBGP session.  \\n➢ A BGP session that spans two Ass is called an external BGP (eBGP) session, and a BGP  \\nsession between routers in the same AS is called an internal BGP (iBGP) session.  \\n➢ Suppose there are four subnets attached to AS2: 138.16.64/24, 138.16.65/24, 138.16.66/24,  \\nand 138.16.67/24. Then AS2 could aggregate the prefixes for these four subnets and use BGP  \\nto advertise the single prefix to 138.16.64/22 to AS1.  \\n \\nPath Attributes and BGP Routes  \\nWhen a router advertises a prefix across a BGP session, it includes with the prefix a number of \\nBGP attributes. A prefix along with its attributes is called a route. Two important attributes are  \\nAS-PATH and NEXT-HOP:  \\n1. AS-PATH. This attribute contains the ASs through which the advertisement for the  \\nprefix has passed. When a prefix is passed into an AS, the AS adds its ASN to the  \\nASPATH attribute. For example in Figure 31, suppose the prefix 138.16.64/24 is first  \\nadvertised from AS2 to AS1and then to AS3, AS-PATH would be AS2 AS1. Routers use  \\nthe AS-PATH attribute to detect and prevent looping advertisements.'),\n",

Providing the critical link between inter-AS and intra-AS routing protocols. The  \\nNEXT-HOP is the router interface that begins the AS-PATH. In Figure 31, suppose the  \\ngateway router 3a in AS3 advertises a route to gateway router 1c in AS1 using eBGP.  \\nThe route includes the advertised prefix, say x, and an AS-PATH to the prefix. This  \\nadvertisement also includes the NEXT-HOP, which is the IP address of the router 3a  \\ninterface that leads to 1c.  \\nBGP Route Selection  \\nIf there are two or more routes to the same prefix, then BGP invokes the following elimination  \\nrules until one route remains:  \\n➢ Routes are assigned a local preference value as one of their attributes. The policy decision  \\nis left to the AS’s network administrator. The routes with the highest local preference  \\nvalues are selected.  \\n➢ From the remaining routes, the route with the shortest AS-PATH is selected. If this is the  \\nonly rule for route selection, then BGP would use a DV algorithm for path determination,  \\nwhere the distance metric uses the number of AS hops.  \\n➢ From the remaining routes, the route with the closest NEXT-HOP router is selected. It  \\ndetermined by the intra-AS algorithm by hot potato routing process. \\nIf more than one route still remains, the router uses BGP identifiers to select the route.  \\nRouting Policy  \\n \\n➢ Figure shows six interconnected autonomous systems: A, B, C, W, X, and Y.  \\n➢ Assume that autonomous systems W, X, and Yare stub networks and that A, B, and C are  \\nbackbone provider networks.  \\n➢ Also assume that A, B, and C, all peer with each other, and provide full BGP information to  \\ntheir customer networks.  \\n➢ All traffic entering a stub network must be destined for that network, and all traffic leaving a  \\nstub network must have originated in that network. W and Y are clearly stub networks.  \\n➢ X is a multi-homed stub network, since it is connected to the rest of the network via two  \\ndifferent providers.  \\n➢ X is prevented from forwarding traffic between B and C by controlling the manner in which  \\nBGP routes are advertised.  \\n➢ That is, even though X may know of a path, say XCY, that reaches network Y, it will not  \\nadvertise this path to B.  \\n➢ Since B is unaware that X has a path to Y, B would never forward traffic destined to Y (or C)  \\nvia X.'),\n",
