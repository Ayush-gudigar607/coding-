Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, machine learning systems use patterns and inference to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.
